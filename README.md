# build-and-deploy-ecr
This github action builds a docker image from a dockerfile, healthchecks it, and pushes it to ECR in compliance with GLG naming conventions

## Requirements

This action requires certain things to be configured in your repo:

1. You must have a **Dockerfile** in the root directory of your repo.

2. You must have the required **secrets** present in your repository. These will be named similar to the following examples:
    1. `{AWS_ACCOUNT_NAME}_ECR_URI`
    2. `{AWS_ACCOUNT_NAME}_ECR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
    3. `{AWS_ACCOUNT_NAME}_ECR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    
    The secrets will be generated automatically, if you use the [glgroup cli](https://github.com/glg/cli) to register your repository.
    
    These secrets values should then be assigned to the corresponding configuration inputs.  (see [Example Usage](#example-usage))
    
3. This action was developed against the `ubuntu-20.04` github actions environment, and it may not work correctly in a different environment.

## Configuration

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| access_key_id | An AWS Access Key ID | **REQUIRED** |
| build_config | Config file used during `docker build` usually `postinstall` (example `webpack.config.js`) to install your app. Do not build your app in `npm install`. | `""` |
| deploy | Whether to push the image to ECR after building it | `"true"` |
| dockerfile | Custom Dockerfile path to use to build your image (`prod.Dockerfile`) | `Dockerfile` |
| ecr_uri | The URI of the ECR repository to push to | **REQUIRED** |
| env_file | File containing environment variables required for app to run and pass healthcheck | `""` |
| github_ssh_key | An SSH Private Key with access to any private repos you need | `""` |
| github_packages_token | A Github token wih read access to the github npm package registry | `""` |
| healthcheck | A healthcheck path, like /healthcheck | `/healthcheck` |
| port | The port the server listens on | `3000` |
| secret_access_key | An AWS Secret Access Key | **REQUIRED** |
| buildkit | Whether to use docker buildkit | `"true"` |
| working_directory | The path to use as the build context, in case you need something besides project root | "." |
| ecr_repository_override | You can manually specify the repository name to push your docker image to. It must start with `github/<org>/<repo>` | `""`

### Config Notes

* `env_file` - The format for this file is `NAME=value` as described in the [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file).
  Notice the lack of the `export` keyword.

## Example Usage

```yml
name: Build Image and Push to ECR
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@main
    - uses: glg-public/build-and-deploy-ecr@main
      with:
        ecr_uri: ${{secrets.ECR_URI}}
        access_key_id: ${{secrets.ECR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}
        secret_access_key: ${{secrets.ECR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}
```

You can optionally disable deploying, and have this action only build your image:

```yml
name: Build Image and Do Not Push to ECR
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@main
    - uses: glg-public/build-and-deploy-ecr@main
      with:
        ecr_uri: ${{secrets.ECR_URI}}
        access_key_id: ${{secrets.ECR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}
        secret_access_key: ${{secrets.ECR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}
        deploy: false
```

## Example with Private Dependencies

```yml
name: Build Image and Push to ECR
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@main
    - uses: glg-public/build-and-deploy-ecr@main
      with:
        ecr_uri: ${{secrets.ECR_URI}}
        access_key_id: ${{secrets.ECR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}
        secret_access_key: ${{secrets.ECR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}
        github_ssh_key: ${{secrets.GITHUB_SSH_KEY}}
```

## Example building arm64 images
```yml
name: Build Image and Push to ECR
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@27d0a4f181a40b142cce983c5393082c365d1480
      with:
        platforms: linux/arm64
    - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@0d135e0c2fc0dba0729c1a47ecfcf5a3c7f8579e
      with:
        install: true
        version: latest
    - uses: glg-public/build-and-deploy-ecr@main
      with:
        ecr_uri: ${{secrets.ECR_URI}}
        access_key_id: ${{secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}
        secret_access_key: ${{secrets.ECR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}
